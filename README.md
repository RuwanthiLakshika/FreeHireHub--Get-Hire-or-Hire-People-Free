# Project: FreeHireHub    


Technology Stack: React | SpringBoot | MongoDB      


As a Full Stack Web Developer, I designed, developed, and maintained both the front-end and back-end components of FreeHireHub, a dynamic platform for both employees and job seekers.    


### Project Overview:     

FreeHireHub is an innovative web platform that bridges the gap between job seekers and employers. Job seekers can showcase their talents by filling out detailed forms, while employers can search and hire the best candidates based on comprehensive indexed data.    


### Key Features:       


MongoDB Compass: Simplifies data visualization and management, providing a user-friendly interface for accessing and interacting with your MongoDB data.       

MongoDB Atlas Search: Enhances search capabilities by indexing every field and text, ensuring employers can find the best match not just by title but by any relevant text in the candidates' profiles.      

Client-Side Field Encryption: Ensures the security of sensitive information, giving both job seekers and employers peace of mind.          


### Highlights:     


Employers can post job listings and search for candidates with precision, thanks to MongoDB Atlas Search.     
Job seekers can present their skills and experiences in a detailed and searchable format.       
The platform offers secure data handling with client-side field encryption, protecting user information.       

FreeHireHub leverages the power of React for a seamless user experience, SpringBoot for robust backend support, and MongoDB for efficient and secure data management.
